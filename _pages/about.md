I study **learning and intelligence through the lens of physics.** My research group blends ideas from statistical physics, information theory and machine learning to understand **how intelligent behavior emerges** in complex systems like deep neural networks, treating AI systems not as a mere engineering problem but as a new frontier for science. 
I am particularly interested in the surprising, emergent phenomena of modern AI. 
Current research themes include the principles behind in-context learning, the universality of neural computation, and the application of physics-motivated concepts like coarse-graining to make AI more interpretable.

I received my PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge ([Theory of Condensed Matter group](https://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/)), followed by postdoctoral research at OIST ([Biological Physics Theory Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/bptu)), Northwestern University ([Condensed Matter Theory group](https://physics.northwestern.edu/research/theoretical-condensed-matter.html)), and CUNY ([Initiative for the Theoretical Sciences](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/initiative-theoretical-sciences) & [Center for the Physics of Biological Function](https://biophysics.princeton.edu/)). I am now a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney.
